# Connor Horman's Writing

## Viewing the Writing

The main branch contains work in progress that may not be complete

The `dist` branch contains published content, which is rendered automatically.

The current published works are available at <TODO: Insert Link before pushing to `dist`>.

You can build or view the `main` branch using `mdbook`, which you can install using `cargo install mdbook`, then run either with `mdbook build` (to build the pages locally) or `mdbook serve` (to spawn a webserver to run it in the background).

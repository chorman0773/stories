# Chapter 1

I stood at the center of the control centre at the Sentinel Research Facility, looking over at the researchers operating control consoles. Directing a question at the one ahead of me on the right, Alyssa, I asked, "Status?"

Alyssa checked something on their console, then responded swiftly, "Reactor Control reports that the chamber is at 90% saturation. Estimate 2 minutes until ignition potential."

"Understood," I responded, then pull up my own console, reviewing the logs from the previous test. This was the third ignition test of the SRF Fusion Reactor. The previous two attempts, designed to allow us to shut down our Antimatter Reactor for good, had failed for various reasons, with the first not even achieving ignition. The second log showed that it had held for 25 seconds before failing. Since then, I had personally worked with some of our top engineers to adjust the ignition program in the Reactor Control System. We also had slightly adjusted the ignition mixture, a soup of ionized deuterium and tritium.

"Sir, Reactor Control reports chamber is at saturation and we can begin the ignition sequence, " the researcher I had previously prompted interrupted my thinking, informing me of the status update.

"Understood. Richard, signal all stations, secure for reactor startup. Alyssa, inform Reactor Control they may commence with Reactor Ignition Sequence," I commanded of the two researchers in front of me.

Richard activated a switch, then used the PA system to announce, "All Stations Secure, All Stations Secure. Secure for Fusion Reactor Startup, All Stations." Following the Announcement, an automated voice began saying "All Stations Secure" over the PA.

Alyssa, spoke to Reactor Control over intercom and, after receiving a response says, "Sir, Reactor Ignition Sequence commenced, 90 seconds til ignition."

The Forward Monitor was then switched to display the current status, showing the internal temperature of 90,000 Kelvin, and pressure at 100 Megapascals. The two numbers were climbing rapidly, the temperature already crossing 95,000 Kelvin after a few seconds. Beside it was a timer, now reading 75 seconds, that indicated the estimated time before the reactor would ignite. The numbers kept climbing faster, the temperature passing 500,000 Kelvins only thirty seconds after the sequence had begun, rushing towards the required 3 Million Kelvins. The Pressure was also incredibly high, now over 350 Megapascals. 

Fourty-five seconds later, a buzzer sounded, to indicate the remaining time. "Sound Precaution," I called to Richard, who hit a button on the console and a loud whine sounded over the PA followed by an automated "Code Yellow. All Stations, possible evac" message. The PA repeated the message over and over, replacing the "All Stations Secure" message that had repeated before. The Numbers now read 5 Million Kelivn and 600 Megapascals, the ignition temperature and pressure, as the clock runs down to zero.

The temperature and pressure stabilized for a few seconds, and a low rumbling can be heard. Everyone was silent, and the only voice that was audible was the automated alert "Code Yellow, All Stations, possible evac". Suddenly, the temperature began to climb again rapidly, crossing 10 Million Kelvins in a matter of seconds, before finally stabilizing at 50 Million Kelvin. Everyone paused for a few seconds, before erupting to applause.

"Status board indicates we have ignition, sir," Alyssa indicated, a few seconds later, "We are now at T+30 seconds, past our previous record."

I nodded, "Cancel Precaution, return to stations secure." Richard complied and the automated alert returned to being "All Stations Secure". I continue, "Continue monitoring the reaction, but..." I almost speak too as the temperature in the core begins dropping rapidly, "Status report."

Alyssa responded promptly, "Reactor Control reports spontaneous loss in core pressure. It stabilized after we released the ignition sequence, but failed shortly after."

As the temperature falls below critical levels, I called out "All Clear. Cancel Stations Secure. Analyze records, and bring me a report."

Richard complies, and the automated message stops repeating, He spoke into the PA, "Cancel All Stations Secure, Situation All Clear. Repeat, Cancel Stations Secure, All Clear. All stations, resume normal operations."

"Reactor to Control" I heared the voice of Mike coming through the intercom.

"Situation, Mike," I called out, "What the hell happened."

"Reaction didn't stabilize. Temperature did but only a few trillion particles ended up fusing before they started to repel. We can't use the mixture again, though, it's already getting contaminated by Lithium," He reported.

"Understood. Once the reactor is at safe temps, vent it. I want a full report on my desk tomorrow, Control Out," I called out before closing the connection.

"Damnit, everything was working, it was perfect this time. We're putting so much of our resources into this," I paused, looking to the others who nod, "Schedule the next trial for one month. It will be the last one, at least for a while. I want it done right this time."

Everyone nods. I call Alyssa up to the command seat, hand her a data tablet which she spent a few minutes reviewing before nodding and I said, "You have command, Alyssa."

"I have Command," Alyssa responded to me, and I left the control centre and headed back to my room to go to sleep, remembering everything that happened.

# Chapter 1

I stood at the center of the control centre at the Sentinel Research Facility, looking over at the researchers operating control consoles. Ahead of me to the, was Richard. He was a relatively new researcher, less than a year in the Sentinel Research Organization, and was manning the General Address and Status Console, which allowed him to send messages through the Facility. On the right was Alyssa. They had been there far longer, approaching their fifth year in the organization, and were manning the Reactor Status Board, which had both detailed information about the source of all power in the facility, but also a direct line to the engineers in Reactor Control. At the center of the room, I was presiding over what would be the third test of our new Fusion Reactor. The previous tests had failed for various reasons, and we were hoping that the third time was the charm. If the reactor tests were successful, we could run the reactor on prolonged usage, potentially being able to shut down our expensive and dangerous antimatter reactor for good.

"Alyssa, Status," I command them, hoping for some good news. We were putting a lot of resources, including person-hours, into these tests, so we likely only will get two attempts more, including this one, before we have to suspend the project.

They checked something on their console, then responded swiftly, "Reactor Control reports that the chamber is at 90% saturation. Estimate 2 minutes until ignition potential."

"Understood," I responded, then pulled up my own console, reviewing the logs from the previous test. That test had failed shortly after ignition, before the reaction had stabilized. The one before that hadn't even started. Since the second test, I had personally worked with our engineers and best researchers on several subjects to adjust the startup process and the intermix to what we were testing today.

"Sir, Reactor Control reports chamber is at saturation and we can begin the ignition sequence, " Alysa prompted, interrupting my reading and train of thought. It was time to begin the test, and I could see the tension in the room go up, Alyssa and Richard both visibly sweating now.

"Understood. Richard, signal all stations, secure for reactor startup. Alyssa, inform Reactor Control they may commence with Reactor Ignition Sequence," I commanded, ready to get this test underway. The procedure was simple, practiced so many times before -- inform all the researchers to pause any non-critical experiments or work, and prepare for further instructions if they become necessary. This was done in case the ignition catastrophically failed and it became necessary to evacuate, or to take less drastic steps that might be disruptive of ordinary life here at Sentinel. 

Richard activated a switch, then used the PA system to announce to everyone, "All Stations Secure, All Stations Secure. Secure for Fusion Reactor Startup, All Stations." Following the Announcement, an automated voice began saying "All Stations Secure" over the PA. The automated message would repeat until it was canceled by my order, or replaced with a more serious status message.

Alyssa, spoke to Reactor Control over intercom and, after receiving a response, answered, "Sir, Reactor Ignition Sequence commenced, 90 seconds til ignition."

The Forward Monitor was then switched to display the current status, showing the internal temperature of 90,000 Kelvin, and pressure at 100 Megapascals. The two numbers were climbing rapidly, the temperature already crossing 95,000 Kelvin after a few seconds. Beside it was a timer, now reading 75 seconds, that indicated the estimated time before the reactor would ignite. The numbers kept climbing faster, the temperature passing 500,000 Kelvins only thirty seconds after the sequence had begun, rushing towards the required 3 Million Kelvin. The Pressure was also incredibly high, now over 350 Megapascals. 

Fourty-five seconds later, a buzzer sounded, to indicate the remaining time. "Sound Precaution, Code Yellow," I called to Richard, who hit a button on the console and a loud whine sounded over the PA followed by an automated "Code Yellow. All Stations, possible evac" message. The PA repeated the message over and over, replacing the "All Stations Secure" message that had repeated before. Code Yellow was the third of 5 distinctive emergency statuses, with the previous "Stations Secure" the lowest possible, and the highest being the "Evacuate, Evacuate, Evacuate" alarm that everyone in sentinel hoped never to hear outside of the regularily scheduled drill. Code Yellow indicated a possible high-risk situation, or the potential for a serious situation, and called for even the most time-sensitive experiments to be put on hold. Below that was Code Blue, which indicated a moderate-risk situation, and above was Code Red, indicating the most serious situation that didn't call for an immediate evacuation, though at Code Red, one was likely imminent.

The Numbers now read 3 Million Kelvin and 600 Megapascals, the ignition temperature and pressure, as the clock runs down to zero. The temperature and pressure then stabilized for a few seconds, and a low rumbling can be heard. Everyone was silent, and the only voice that was audible was the automated alert "Code Yellow, All Stations, possible evac". Suddenly, the temperature began to climb again rapidly, crossing 10 Million Kelvins in a matter of seconds, before finally stabilizing at 50 Million Kelvin. Everyone paused for a few seconds, before erupting to applause.

"Status board indicates we have ignition, sir," Alyssa indicated, a few seconds later, "We are now at T+30 seconds, past our previous record."

I nodded, "Cancel Precaution, return to stations secure." Richard complied and the automated alert returned to being "All Stations Secure". I continue, "Continue monitoring the reaction, but..." I almost speak too as the temperature in the core begins dropping rapidly, "Status report."

Alyssa responded promptly, "Reactor Control reports spontaneous loss in core pressure. It stabilized after we released the ignition sequence, but failed shortly after."

As the temperature falls below critical levels, I called out, "All Clear. Cancel Stations Secure. Analyze records, and bring me a report."

Richard complies, and the automated message stops repeating, He spoke into the PA, "Cancel All Stations Secure, Situation All Clear. Repeat, Cancel Stations Secure, All Clear. All stations, resume normal operations."

"Reactor to Control" I heard the voice of Mike coming through the intercom. Mike was the most senior engineer in the organization, and had been in charge of every reactor test so far. He even was one of the lead designers and engineers that built the thing. If anyone knew what had just happened, he would for sure.

"Situation, Mike," I called out, a slight mix of disappointment and irritation in my voice, "What the hell happened."

"Reaction didn't stabilize. Temperature did but only a few trillion particles ended up fusing before they started to repel. We can't use the mixture again, though, it's already getting contaminated by Lithium," He reported.

"Understood. Once the reactor is at safe temps, vent it. Work with Alyssa and your team and find out what exactly went wrong this time. I want a full report on my desk tomorrow, Control Out," I called out before closing the connection.

"Dammit, everything was working, it was perfect this time. We're putting so much of our resources into this," I paused, looking to the others who nod, "Schedule the next trial for one month. It will be the last one, at least for a while. I want it done right this time."

Everyone nods in vehement agreement. I then look at the time and decide it is time to retire to my room, so I began the process of turning over command. I summoned Alyssa to the command chair, who entered a record into the console, and another researcher I didn't know the name of took their place at the RSB console. I handed them a data pad that contained a record of everything that had happened since I took command a few hours ago, as well as the previous logs. Alyssa spent a few minutes reviewing the information contained in the pad. It was as routine a procedure as anything at all that happened at the Facility, this several minute exchange happening many times daily, not just in the Control Centre, but at command stations around the facility. Mike was probably, at this very moment, reviewing the engineering logs with his replacement, so he could retire. After Alyssa finished, they nodded, and I spoke in a commanding tone, both to them and everyone else in the room, "You have Command, Alyssa." 

"I have Command," They responded in the same authorative manner, informing me that they acknowledge the change in command, and informing the rest of the duty personnel of that change.

I left the Control Centre and retired to my room to go to sleep. As I walked, I recalled the events of the test, my brain searching for answers to the scenario. I could only hope that the report from Mike would shed some light on what went wrong, and that it was something that could be fixed. Once I got back to my room, I got straight into bed, and let sleep take me, electing to sort out my thoughts in the morning.

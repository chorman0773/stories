# Chapter 8 - Understanding

"So… I guess we're alone again," Ruiko says, still with considerable tension in the air, after Misaka has gone to bed.

"I guess… So, uh, have you had a chance to think about what I told you?" Frenda asks, kind of scared but also intrigued to hear the noirette's response to her earlier confession.

"Oh, you mean what you said to me at the hospital, uh…" Frenda looks down and away at Ruiko's statement, clearly inferring an answer, "No, no. It's not what you think. I do like you as well, I think in that way… it's just…"

Frenda looks up at Ruiko, questioning what Ruiko is intending, and her face scrunches into an inquisitive look. Ruiko continues, "I've learned a lot of new things about you in the past 24 hours. I'm… not sure what to do about it, and I need time to process it all," Ruiko explains, with a bit of an apologetic tone, "I can't commit to being your girlfriend right now, but I'm not saying no either. Just… give me time to sort everything out and I'll give you my answer, ok?" Ruiko ends with a smile and Frenda gives an understanding nod. With the tension mostly gone, Ruiko decided to switch topics, "So, what was that you were saying about Misaka-san and Kuroko-san?"

"Oh, I can't believe you haven't figured it out--" Frenda is interrupted by Kuroko teleporting in with Kinuhata Saiai. 

"Oh, good timing," Frenda said, slightly rolling her eyes, "Judgement Officer, we need to talk." She pauses before acknowledging Saiai, "Kinuhata-san. What happened? Who attacked us?"

"I don't know Seivelun-san, but they were definitely after you. Guess they aren't thrilled with you… talking to 'Judgement Officers'," Saiai answered, "What are we running here, Deputy Kuroko. I assume at least level 4 given you couldn't tell me in the field."

"Level 5, Mission Commander wants to debrief Frenda, but otherwise gave me full authority to determine security," Kuroko Responds.

"Frenda must be valuable to Anti-Skill, then? To allow running that level of concealment. Good thinking though, you'll want that  secrecy here if any of us, save for maybe the level 5, are to survive," Kinuhata explains, "Don't debrief yet though. Do everything you can to maintain classification. If you'll trust me, I can assist, I have lots of experience running off the books ops."

"That bad, huh?" Shirai asks, to which Saiai replies, "You instituted Level 5 procedures, you tell me."

"Ok, is someone going to let me in on the secret? What's Level 5 security?" Ruiko asked, puzzled, "you can't just disobey the request of your commander, can you?"

Frenda shoots Kuroko a look that said 'You tell her or I will', so the salmon-haired girl relents, "For the duration of a Level 5 Mission, the commander of the mission — in this case, me — has absolute discretion in the classification, and dissemination, of information related to the mission. Nothing short of a declassification order from the Board of Directors, or an internal investigation warrant, can override my discretion to maintain that information in any manner of security necessitated," Kuroko explains, "and yes, I could defer the debrief order if there was a legitimate security interest to do so."

"There is one. We, ITEM, had contact with agents inside Anti-skill. I can only assume whoever is after Seivelun-san is similarly situated," Saiai informs Kuroko and everyone else. 

"You had agents inside of Anti-skill?" Kuroko asks and Saiai shakes her head.

 "They weren't our agents, but we typically had contact with them through our employers. They gathered information, but also highly placed and could interfere with operations."

The implications of the underworld having direct access to high levels of Anti-skill begins to sink in for Kuroko. The corruption ran deeper than she had thought. And certainly with the power to change orders would be a substantial step in hiding a large scale criminal operation like Level Six Shift. The pieces still didn't fully add up, though.

"Who were your employers?" Kuroko asks, directing the question to both members of ITEM present.

"We can't answer that, we never had direct contact with them," Frenda was the one to answer, "only one person in ITEM did, and that person is now very much dead."

"Mugino," Misaka walks out from the bedroom, saying the name everyone, save for Ruiko, had figured out, "The leader of ITEM. Fourth Ranked Level 5, Meltdowner."  Frenda, Saiai, and Kuroko all nod.

"There might be ways to find out who they are, though," Kuroko says, "if they have agents in Anti-skill, we might be able to use that. Expose the corruption, and clear it out."

"You don't have to do that, Kuroko. It's too dangerous, and likely far too big," Misaka says, concerned for her friend and dorm mate. "You can't take it down all on your own."

"Says the person who took on an entire criminal operation by herself, " Kuroko shot back, "No, when I joined Judgement, I swore to protect the city. Even if I'm protecting it from a criminal enterprise that has a connection to Anti-skill."

"Well, I'm in," everyone was surprised by Ruiko's voice joining in, "These are the people after Frenda, right?" Saiai nods, "I'll do what I can to help protect my Mackerel buddy. I'm sure Uiharu-chan will help as well." Ruiko and Frenda both smile, though Frenda more with a solemn look. 

"... Alright. But I'm helping you, Shirai," Misaka said, reluctantly, "I declined your help, Shirai, when I did something dangerous, but that I felt was right. I won't let you make that mistake."

Frenda looked concerned and flags over Kuroko, "can I talk to you, in private?" The two of them walk towards the bedroom, and Misaka looks a bit confused, "Don't worry Railgun, I won't steal her from you. Not me."

The two of them enter the more private room, and close the door, "You really need to actually make a move on Misaka, if you want her. Like, actually make a move, Shirai."

"Believe me, I've tried," Kuroko shakes her head, "what was it you wanted to tell me."

"I want Ruiko kept out of this, Misaka said it, this is dangerous," Frenda explains, "Even before… all this, I was attacked in a mall, and Ruiko could have become collateral damage. I don't want her to be caught in this."

Kuroko shakes her head, "Sometimes the people we love do things that are dangerous, because they think they're right. Like when Misaka went after your project, I didn't want her involved, but I knew I couldn't stop her. So I tried to help her instead."

"I'm not sure I can help. I'm not sure I want to be involved in this, and I'm not sure you want me either," Frenda responds back, solemnly, "I don't want back in to that, not even from this side."

"You don't want to uncover the people who tried to have you killed?" Kuroko asks, and Frenda shakes her head, "Why not?"

"Frankly, less than 2 days ago, I was convinced I was going to be killed. The only reason I refused to surrender to that is sitting outside. I don't want her involved in this, and I'm not sure she knows what she's getting into. And I'm not sure I can do much more about it. Mugino was one thing, we had far more dangerous allies and rivals." Frenda answered back.

"Well, Ruiko wants to be involved to save you," Kuroko responds, with a smile this time, "I don't think you can dissuade her from that. So, you should support her. Help us take down the corruption, if not for yourself or the city, then for Saten Ruiko."

Frenda pauses to think, for what seems like an eternity before giving a slight nod, "Alright, I'll do it. But understand that my priority will be protecting her, not you, and not the Railgun."

After the pair had left, Saiai, Misaka, and Ruiko were left in the living room together, Saiai still standing from before. While they were silent for a bit, Misaka finally broke the ice, "So, Kinuhata-san, I don't suppose you'll help us."

"I want to keep Seivelun-san safe, but beyond that, I'm not sure," Saiai responds.

"Why do you even care so much about her," Misaka asks, skeptical.

"With Mugino dead, I'm the acting leader of ITEM. I gotta keep my team safe." Saiai says, then sighs, "and truthfully, I think I also want out, we all did. With Mugino dead, we have our chance."

Misaka nods, and turns to Ruiko, who simply looks lost in thought at this point. Misaka decides to also take this time to descend into her own thoughts, including about the girl standing in front of her.

# Chapter 6 - Protection

*Riiiing*. Misaka is woken up by the ringing of her phone. She checks the time: 06:13. Who would be calling her at this hour? The Display says "Unknown Number", she shrugs and picks up "Hello?"

"Misaka," the panicked voice of Kinuhata Saiai comes through the speaker, "I wouldn't be calling unless it were absolutely necessary. We've been attacked, one of our members is dead. They're after Frenda, she's in danger."

"What? Who attacked, and why?" Misaka responds, confused.

"We don't know, we didn't see them. I know I don't have the right to ask this on her behalf, but please, protect her." Saiai, still panicked, and sounding like she is out of breath, hangs up after answering.

"Who was that?" Ruiko was the second one awakened by Misaka's phone call.

"Saiai, the girl who was here earlier for Frenda. Her… organisation was attacked by someone. She asked me to protect Frenda." Misaka answered.

"If she's in danger, then please do…" Ruiko's face turns a faint pink as she answers, "I… don't know what I'd do if she is killed."

"I think we should protect her," Kuroko said, clearly now awake as well, "I think she can provide valuable testimony to Anti-skill. Particularly if there is corruption going on, we may be able to blow it right open. If you'll agree to help, Misaka, then I'll get protection authorization when I call Anti-skill."

"... I don't like it, but I'll help. For both of you." Misaka relents to helping protect Frenda.

"Alright, I'll call the ATU." Kuroko puts on her earpiece and presses a button on it. "This is Judgement Officer Shirai Kuroko. I'd like to speak to the OIC for the 2-16B Warehouse case, I have a report to give." Kuroko paused for a minute while waiting, then continued, "Yes, hello officer. I've spoken to Frenda Seivelun in regards to the case. Given her statement, I have a strong reason to believe that the death of Shizuki Mugino in this case was an act of Self Defense. Mugino presented a grave risk of death to Frenda, and Frenda's belief that no other options would eliminate that threat were reasonable in the circumstances."

"Thank you for the report on that, Officer Kuroko. I'll want to have her speak to that directly, but for now I'll trust your judgement on it, I know you've done good work for us, both in the past and on this case," The Officer said over the earpiece, "There is still a matter of the destruction of property, though that won't be a terrorism charge, given the circumstances."

Kuroko, hearing the instructions, answers the officer, "In regards to the destroyed buildings, they were unused and empty, correct? I have reason to believe Frenda has important testimony regarding criminal activities in Academy City, and may be willing to provide it in exchange for immunity for the destruction of those buildings, and acts taken under duress induced by Shizuki Mugino. I thus would recommend that Anti-skill draft and provide an Immunity Agreement in exchange for that testimony." 

"I can't say that's standard procedure for someone in organised crime. If you have an idea of what kind of testimony she can provide though, we can consider a tentative deference of prosecution."

"Yes, I believe she has knowledge of official acts of corruption, and would be able and willing to testify as to that." Kuroko answers, "In regards to that, a personal request. It has come to my attention that others in criminal organisations may wish to harm or kill Frenda, likely in part to silence her testimony. I'd like to place her into the protection of Anti-skill. I personally will have the assistance of Misaka Mikoto, Level 5 Electromaster, to aid in guarding her."

"Unfortunately, we can't spare any officers at this time. And it would be unusual, to say the least, to have a Judgement Officer run Protected Custody." The Officer Pauses for a moment, "You say you will have the assistance of a level 5?"

"That is correct, third ranked."

"And you are one of our most reliable officers, even better than some in Anti-skill. Alright. Judgement Officer Kuroko, by my authority as Chief for the Anti-Skill Anti-terrorisim Unit, I am temporarily deputising you to Anti-skill, and ordering you to take command of the Frenda Seivelun Case. Pending a decision on an immunity agreement in exchange for testimony, you will take custody of Frenda and ensure her safety. You may use whatever resources are available for this assignment, and the opsec for this assignment is what you deem necessary."

"Alright, thank you officer. I will not let you down. I'd like to deputise Judgement Officer Uiharu Kazari and Level 5 Misaka Mikoto for this assignment, to have their assistance." Kuroko made her final requests.

"If you believe them prepared and capable, you have my authorization." The Officer responded, "Good Luck, Deputy Kuroko."

"Thank you Kuroko turned off the call. "Alright, I'm now in charge of protecting Frenda. Misaka, Ruiko, I'll need your assistance, as much as possible. I'll also need Uiharu's assistance, once she's awake. Misaka, since you'll be actively assisting me in protecting her, if you're ok with it, I'm making you a deputy to assist me in this case. To be clear, that means that you report to me, and you *don't *go off on your own vigilante quest."

Misaka, startled by the sudden request, took a minute to think, but then agreed. "If my cooperation can help blow the lid on the corruption here in the city, then I'll help you. And… I guess I can play by your rules if you need me to, Kuroko. But I want it to be you asking, not Judgement or Anti-skill or whoever."

"It is… Onee-sama. It is." Kuroko assured her, speaking as a friend, rather than as a Judgement Officer - now Anti-skill Deputy - then switched tones to start giving them a briefing, "Now, to be clear, we need to keep this out of the ears of her attackers for as long as possible. You don't talk about this to anyone other than Frenda, or one of us, without my permission. Not even Anti-skill, I'll take care of briefing them. If they ask you, inform them it's an opsec level 5 operation and direct them to me." 

"Sounds serious, if we can't even tell Anti-skill," Ruiko responds, clearly understanding the situation. She doesn't want the attackers to get to Frenda

"It is. Now, we need a place to keep Frenda for the duration of the protection. The Tokiwadai dorms are out, even with an order from Anti-skill, we wouldn't be able to keep her there for too long, plus it would be hard to move her in in secret." Kuroko states, and starts thinking.

"What about my apartment?" Ruiko offers, "All of you are welcome to stay there while we're keeping Frenda safe."

Kuroko thinks for a moment, then agrees. "Alright, that's what we'll do. When Frenda wakes up, I'll brief her - Ruiko I'd like you there as well - and if she gives her permission I'll teleport all of us to your place. After that, I'll brief Uiharu and inform Konori that we're on special assignment with Anti-skill. Misaka, can you inform the Dorm Mother that we'll be away for an extended period of time."

Misaka nods, "She'll want to know what we're doing and why, most likely."

"Yeah, and you won't be able to tell her," Kuroko states back, "If she has a complaint about that, tell her she can call Anti-skill and ask for Officer Tessou with the ATU. She'll be able to confirm my deputization and that I'm running an operation for Anti-skill."

Doctor Heaven Canceler interrupted the conversation by walking in, "Excuse me young ladies, but my patient is now awake, and is ready to be discharged. If one of you can come sign for her, we can clear the case up."

"That will be me," Kuroko speaks up, "per Anti-skill order, she's to be released into my custody for the protection of Anti-skill. I don't think I need to tell this to a doctor, but please, don't speak to anyone about the fact that Frenda was here or that she was released to my custody. We have reason to believe there may be threats to her life."

"Well, no one who would cause harm to my patient will hear where she is from me. You don't need to worry yourself about that," the doctor responded, "If you'll come with me then, Ms. Shirai."

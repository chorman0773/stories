# A Certain Happy Ending ([M], F/F, F/M)

Frenda Seveilun sold out ITEM when captured by SCHOOL, only to die at the hands of Mugino. But what if she didn't, and a carefully layed and executed plan succeeds in killing Mugino instead. A snowball of fate from that moment might just turn Academy City itself upside down.

# Chapter 2 - Confronting a Madwoman

"Frenda…" A high, almost sadistic voice calls out for her. Mugino has arrived, so it's time to put the plan into motion. Frenda started running in a direction that was generally away from where the voice was, but that would make it easy for her to catch up. She had to sell her actions as desperate, rather than carefully calculated, or it wouldn't work.

"Oh Frenda…" The voice is getting closer, the plan seems to be working. "Frenda, did you think you could get away with selling *me *out?" Mugino was getting closer. With a (mostly) fake look of despair on her face, Frenda starts to turn towards the first of the two buildings, rigged with explosives. She just needs Mugino not to catch her for the 90 seconds until she reaches it. Those 90 seconds, of course, will seem like an eternity.

*Kaboom… *Frenda barely makes it a third of the way there before Mugino's signature move, Meltdowner, rips through one of the buildings. Frenda's fake look of fear briefly twists into a real one for a few seconds, but she keeps running, turning to lead the Level 5 towards hopefully Mugino's death. She arrives at the building where the first trap is set, pausing for a moment to make sure Mugino sees her, though trying to conceal the pause as hesitation. The plan is going perfectly so far, and Frenda slightly smirks.

Frenda enters the building, with Mugino now just behind her, her deranged voice calling, "Frenda. You can't run forever. Now I've got you." Mugino begins to charge up her meltdowner ability.

"No, Mugino, now I've got you. You didn't think I wouldn't prepare for this, did you?" Frenda ignites the fuse beneath her feet and sprints off, Mugino trailing and yelling "Frenda." The fuse runs out as the 4th ranked level 5 is still hot in pursuit, and then hundreds of explosives Frenda had set up finally go off. Frenda manages to dive out of the building just before it starts to come down on top of the enraged esper. Not being done, Frenda dashes over to the second building, which has been relatively sealed for most of the day, now saturated with Natural Gas.

"Frenda… did you really think that would stop me? Didn't really seem like preparation, more like a last ditch effort to avoid your fate." Mugino slowly follows Frenda into the second building, confident, but even more incensed than before. Frenda starts running to the exit on the other side of the building as Mugino starts charging Meltdowner for the final blow. 

"No, that wouldn't, but this will!" Frenda barely gets to the threshold of the door as Mugino fires off the attack. The high energy blast immediately ignites the Methane saturated with oxygen, spontaneously combusting in a rapidly growing explosion, instantly consuming Mugino. There was no way she survived that. 

Frenda tries to dive away, but she is caught in the tail edge of the blast and thrown to the ground. She feels her consciousness fading and needs to call for help. Going into her phone she goes for Saiai but something in her subconscious causes her to click on Saten Ruiko instead. As the familiar voice of her friend picks up, she says just a few words before falling unconscious, "I'm in the warehouse district, and I need help. Come find me, please, Ruiko."

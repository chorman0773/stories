# Chapter 5 - Level Six

"Well, Kuroko? Did you get anything from Frenda?" Misaka asks, in a quiet tone, to avoid awakening their already sleeping friend.

"She fairly readily confessed to killing Mugino. She said that she had strong reason to believe that Mugino would try and was trying to kill her. Textbook case of self-defence, in my opinion. A bit overkill, but Mugino was a level 5. By Frenda's account, one who could threaten you, Onee-san. I'd want some corroboration before I make my recommendation to Anti-Skill, of course," Kuroko answers, having made up her mind.

"What about the destroyed buildings? Aren't they going to want her for that?" Misaka counters, unsure about the whole thing.

"Anti-Skill gave me their interim report before ordering me to assume custody of Frenda. The buildings in question have been unused for about a year now. They're probably going to be more interested in getting information from her. That's likely going to be my recommendation -- Immunity in exchange for Information about ITEM and its dealings."

"What about the… incident, when she tried to kill me in the same way she apparently did in Mugino?"

"About that, Onee-san…"

Kuroko walks into the room where Frenda was still lying, with her Judgement Armband still on her arm. "Frenda Seivelun? My name is Shirai Kuroko, with Judgement. I want to ask you some questions about the incident yesterday at 14:37, in the warehouse district."

"Ah yes, a police officer. You're the teleporter that's always with the Railgun, aren't you. No, I don't think I'll be answering any questions of yours," Frenda turns away from Kuroko, refusing to be interrogated.

"Alright, I'll be going then. Apologies for wasting your time." Kuroko turns to leave, but Frenda stops her.

"Wait. Why are you here? Just as an officer?" Frenda asked Kuroko.

"I helped bring you here. I was with my friend when she got a panicked phone call from you. I teleported you, Frenda, and Misaka here and had you brought to Intensive Care."

 "You're a friend of Ruiko's? And, with the Railgun… there's something there, isn't there, between you?" Frenda asks, knowingly.

"How did you…" Kuroko is shocked for a second, then regains her composure, "No. There isn't. I wish there was, but there isn't. We're just friends"

"I see, so it's like that. Very well, I'll answer your questions." Frenda turns back and agrees.

"Alright. At or before 14:37 yesterday, two abandoned warehouses were destroyed. You were found behind the rubble of one, and in the same one, the body of the Level 5 Shizuki Mugino was found."

Under her breath, Frenda mumbles, "Thank god she's dead," returning to a normal voice, "I suppose you want to know if I destroyed the warehouses. I did, while fleeing from a very pissed off Meltdowner."

"She wanted you dead?" Frenda nods, which Kuroko takes note of, "Why is that?"

"I was captured. To escape, I let slip some information I shouldn't. Mugino considered that capital treason, and decided to perform a little execution."

"So, it was self-defence, then? Why the destruction, though?" Kuroko asks.

"Have you ever fought a level 5 before?" Kuroko shakes her head, "I had to make sure the job got done. I know Mugino, and doubt she'd get the message from anywhere other than the Morgue."

"I guess you have experience with fighting a level 5 then?"

"Been talking with the Railgun? I suppose if you're friends, she told you all about that business during Project Level Six Shift. Let's just say… Mugino can be very persuasive. Yesterday was the first time I had the courage… or the motivation to do anything about that. Well… not like I had much choice, other than just letting her… carry out her threat… Well, that's my story. I assume you're going to throw me in prison now."

"You considered letting her kill you, didn't you…" Frenda looks away and doesn't respond, "Well Frenda, I have to make a report to Anti-Skill in the morning. If I can get someone to back up what you're saying, that report will recommend you be released from my custody when you are discharged from the hospital. Clearly you had good reasons for what you did, and I can write up Mugino's death as self-defence."

Dr. Heaven Canceler comes in, "Time is up, Kuroko. We must let Frenda rest, and I won't let you use my hospital room as an interrogation room any longer."

"Wait. Frenda, you said yesterday was the first time you had motivation to stop Mugino's threat. Why was that."

"The same reason you brought the Railgun… Misaka here. My motivation for surviving, you brought her here as well."

Dr. Heaven Canceler escorts Kuroko out of the Hospital room, leaving Frenda to sleep.

"And that's what she told me. By the way, Onee-san, why didn't you tell me what happened? What was Project Level Six Shift?" Kuroko asks, with the same interrogative tone as with Frenda.

"She told you about that??" Misaka asked in a raised voice, before quieting back down when she notices Ruiko shifting about in her bed.

Kuroko shakes her head, "No, she just mentioned the name when I brought up the time you fought her. Thought you had told me. You said she had tried to kill you, I can only guess that was when. And you never told me. When was this? What was it? Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you let me help you?" 

"I didn't want to get you involved. It was private, and my responsibility. I didn't want you to get hurt." Misaka answers Kuroko's distressed question. "The people involved in that project were very dangerous, and I'm not talking about ITEM."

"All the more reason for me *to* have been involved. So you didn't have to face those dangers alone. Do you know what it would have done to me if I lost you?  I want you to tell me exactly what Project Level Six Shift is," Shirai responds in a firm tone.

"I suppose there's no way I'm getting out of this, is there," Shirai shakes her head and Misaka signs, "Well, the project is exactly what you might expect from the name. The goal was to create a Level Six esper, specifically, improving the level of the Most powerful Esper in the City - the 1st Ranked Level 5, Accelerator."

"And how did they plan to reach level 6? Even Accelerator is miles away from Level 6. It's not something that could just be done."

"According to their calculations using the Tree Diagram, if Accelerator were to defeat and kill 128 espers at my power level, Accelerator's power would gradually increase until he reached Level 6. But of course, they won't find 128 espers at *my* power level."

"I do not like where this is going. If they need 128 espers at your power level, how would they get that, except with direct cloning."

"Project Radio Noise. When I was younger, I was coerced and duped into allowing the people behind the project to take a copy of my genetic code. They had planned to create clones of me, for some other purpose. The original project was scrapped when it was discovered the clone only had a fraction of my esper abilities. However, when the Tree Diagram turned up a different calculation, in terms of the clones from that project would have been produced. 20,000 of the Radio Noise clones would have produced the same effect."

"That's… horrible. But, you said "would have", they didn't actually carry out the experiment, did they? I mean, I don't even know who they are, but they wouldn't have been able to without being discovered by Anti-Skill."

Misaka nods her head, solemnly, "I first discovered the project after meeting the 9852nd clone to be used for the experiment. The 9852nd clone to be sent to fight and die to Accelerator. After that, I was able to put an end to the experiments, with the 10032nd clone being the first survivor."

"10031. 10031 clones of you. Killed just like that. For an experiment. For Research. Who could allow such a thing? Who could do such a thing? How could it happen under the noses of the people who keep Academy City safe. Who ran that project?"

"I don't think you want to know, Kuroko. I found the record, while I was putting an end to it, but I do not think you want to hear it."

"You know what? I'll trust you when you say that. But still, you should have let me help you. If they were truly that dangerous, you shouldn't have faced them alone. I can help you, and I could not bear it if you didn't come home one night or any night after. Promise me that you'll never face something like this alone ever again, Misaka. Promise me that you'll me help you, help make sure that you'll be coming home."

"I…" Kuroko glares at Misaka, "Alright, I promise. Now, let's get some sleep, before we wake up Saten-san." Misaka lies down on one of the beds and goes to sleep and Kuroko shortly follows suit.
